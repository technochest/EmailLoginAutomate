This is a very simple example of logging into your email account using Python Selenium, PyAutoGui, and OpenCV libarries.
In this example, I show how we can easilty automate the tast of logging into our email accounts and even take it further
as having the bot read our email for us...find specific email that we or sort our email box as we please....

This is an excellent tool for everyone...

Thanks,
