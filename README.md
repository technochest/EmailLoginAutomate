This is a very simple example of logging into your email account using Python Selenium, PyAutoGui, and OpenCV libarries.
In this example, we automate the task of logging into our email accounts.  In this particular example I am loggin to Micrsoft Live  account to check my email...

We can even take it further as having the bot read our email for us...find specific email that we are looking for or sort our mail box as we please....

This is an excellent tool for coders/SE/SD...

Thanks,
JB
